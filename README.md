## Speech-to-Text Multi-Language Project
This project demonstrates a simple speech-to-text converter in Python that supports multiple languages, including English (India), Hindi, and Bengali. The project utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to capture audio from the microphone and convert it to text using Google's Web Speech API.

## Features
1. Supports speech recognition in English (India), Hindi, and Bengali.
2. Captures audio from the microphone and converts it to text in real-time.
3. Easy to extend to other languages supported by the Google Web Speech API.
##Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine.
2. Pip package manager installed.
3. A working microphone connected to your computer.
##Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-multi-language.git
cd speech-to-text-multi-language `
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you encounter issues with PyAudio installation on Windows, you may need to install it using a pre-built binary from this site.
Verify the installation by running:

bash
Copy code
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; import pyaudio"
If no errors are raised, you're ready to run the project.

## Usage
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Choose your preferred language by entering 1 for English, 2 for Hindi, or 3 for Bengali.

Speak into your microphone, and the recognized text will be displayed on the screen.
